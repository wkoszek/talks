# How to contribute back to Open Source?

## Abstract

I am often asked how to contribute to Open Source. We all use it, benefit
from it and we the value added, and at some point we start to feel bad of
being just consumers. "Maybe I should help out? What if I fixed these 2 bugs
I hit everyday?", some of us think. In this talk I'm going to talk about
what I learned about dynamics of open source projects and how you can make
contributing back to them your daily habit. Open source often has high
quality bar and some of us are hesitant to publicly making mistakes during
learning curve, but I found that it's the best way to learn as an engineer.
After this talk I hope you'll see how leaving your mark in your favorite
tools can be useful and fulfilling.
